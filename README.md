## InstaPicsScript
This is a plug-in for GIMP 2.10. It takes an image, checks whether the width or height is larger, and then creates a square image based on the larger dimension. It adds a background color and padding, placing your original image in the center.

On Windows, the folder containing the script needs to be placed here:
<pre> C:\Users\"your-user-name"\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins </pre>

## InstaSquare
This Go app allows you to use the plug-in without opening GIMP manually. You can either drag and drop a file or select one manually from your PC. Once the image is processed, the new version is saved in the **InstaPictures** folder on your desktop.

Currently, only .jpg files are supported.
